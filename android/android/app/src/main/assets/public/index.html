<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
Save the file as index.html inside the www directory.

After creating the index.html file manually, you can proceed with the remaining steps to synchronize your project with Capacitor.

Again, I apologize for the confusion caused. Let me know if you have any further questions!
